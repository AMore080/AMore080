Hello, I'm Alex! I'm a learning full-stack developer wanting to start a career in web development. I am currently enrolled in the University of Minneosta Bootcamp and am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science looking to graduate from the University of Houston. My coding projects consist of personal works and assignments I was tasked to complete while in the bootcamp. I hope to sharpen my coding skills and look forward to meeting you!
